# TEST DRIVE A SINGLE-CLASS PROGRAM

----

## Objective

To learn how to test-drive a single-class program by focusing on the 'Create Examples as Tests' and 'Implement behaviour' steps firts.

Test-driving a single-class program is similar to test-driving a single-method program but the approach is different because methods and classes are different: A ==Method== is a reusable chunk of code that takes input as arguments and returns a value whilst A ==Class== is a blueprint for creating objects.

----

**In object-oriented programming, the most important unit of behaviour is the Class.** Programs are built by creating classes that work together to accomplish the job of the program.
To learn and understand this, I am going to:

[x] Test drive a single-class program.

[ ] Design a single-class program.

[ ] Test drive a system of classes.

[ ] Design a system of classes.
